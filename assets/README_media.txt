Place your real media files here to replace the placeholders used in the site.

Files to add:
- hero.mp4      -> The hero background video (MP4). Path: assets/hero.mp4
- download.jpeg -> The before image used as poster and the 'before' shot. Path: assets/download.jpeg
- download-after.jpeg -> Optional: the after image. Path: assets/download-after.jpeg

If you add these files, the site will use the local copies instead of the embedded placeholders or remote fallback.

Notes:
- Keep media sizes optimized for web (use a compressed MP4 and JPEGs).
- If you want to test locally without adding files, the page will fall back to remote video and embedded tiny images.
